            <p>
            Hello! I'm Jeremy Permaul, a recent graduate of University of California Riverside Full Stack Bootcamp, where I trained intensively in full stack web development. With a passion for coding and a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I am eager to start my career as a software developer.

            During my bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, among other technologies. I completed several projects that involved designing and building responsive web applications, developing RESTful APIs, and collaborating with peers in an Agile environment.

            What excites me most about coding is the ability to solve real-world problems and create user-friendly applications that make a difference. I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends and best practices.

            In my spare time, I enjoy participating in coding challenges, leaning new things, excercising and playing chess, which keeps me motivated and sharp. I am actively seeking my first opportunity in the tech industry where I can contribute, grow, and learn alongside talented professionals.
